# solar

This repository is about a solar installation and a combined diy battery. Goal of the hard- and software is to keep the feed in to the public grid around zero and use the stored energy in the battery if needed. 

The system is attached to the public grid - it is at this moment not capable of providing power during a blackout as it uses small grid inverters.
