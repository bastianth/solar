# solar

This repository is about a solar installation and a combined diy battery. Goal of the hard- and software is to keep the feed in to the public grid around zero and use the stored energy in the battery if needed. 

The system is attached to the public grid - it is at this moment not capable of providing power during a blackout as it uses small grid inverters (they only work with a provided frequency on the AC-Side by the grid). 

*How it started*

Small solar installations became quite popular in Germany in recent years. Due to the energy price hike after the starting war in Ukraine electricity was priced near 0,40â‚¬ per kWh. To compensate, many households installed so called "balcony power plants" - direct translation from German. 

These small solar installations are quite easy to install and easy to get approved by the local grid operator. To ensure a full approved operation, 2 things are necessary:
  
- register the installation to Marktstammdatenregister (online: https://www.marktstammdatenregister.de/MaStR/)
- announce the installation to your local grid operator
